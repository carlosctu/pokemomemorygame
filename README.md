## About The Project

<p align="justify"> My Fourth project at Driven Education Bootcamp. This time, i decided to change the layout and the visual of the project given, since i always
wanted to make a project about Pokemon (:. This project is basically a Memory Game, is just, instead of seeing boring pictures everytime you turn a card, you will see a
Pokemon Gif (:. This project will also ask you how many cards you want to play with, and upon entering the game you will see a timer that will start
count from the moment you turn over a card.
This project isavailable for desktop, tablet and mobile, so be free to use it on every device because the layout and background change.</p>
